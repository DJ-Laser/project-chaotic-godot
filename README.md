# Project Chaotic Godot
Project Chaotic Godot is a Godot game where anyone in the Hack Club server can add anything to the game (as long as it's not purposefully a vandalism pull request or bigotry/hatred). It will be... well, chaotic. I'll try to commit as many pull requests as possible

## Make sure to `git pull origin main` before coding!
 
## Rules:
* No vandalism (Purposefully griefing, destroying, excessively overwriting other people's code or assets)
* No bigotry (Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc...) or usage of slurs
* Describe what you added in your PR/commit messages
